    Java Basic:
    1.
    Java is an object-oriented programming language.
    Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects(except primitive type), along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

    Custom Object class
        toString();  print / log object
        hashCode();  not unique
        equals(Object obj);
    2.
    Naming Convention:
        class MyClass
        myMethod()

    3.
    static keyword
        method
        variable
        class : inner class
        static block vs non-static block
        cannot call non-static attribute/method/this from static method
        cannot override but can overload

    4.
    Java pass by value


    5.
    OOP Concept:
        Polymorphism:
            runtime: method overriding
            compile time: method overloading
            upcasting
        Inheritance:
        Encapsulation:
        Abstraction:

    6.
    final
    immutable(String, String Pool)

    7.
    finally:
        try/catch/finally

    8.
    Exceptions:
        Runtime(uncheck)/Compile time(checked)
